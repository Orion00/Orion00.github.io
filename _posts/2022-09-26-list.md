```python
someIterable = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[var1*2 for var1 in someIterable]

x_coors = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
y_coors = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[(x,y) for x in x_coors for y in y_coors]

```

# Section for people who want to know more
Have you ever wondered why an "easy to read" language like Python has syntax like this?
```python
list_comp = [x**2 for x in range(20) if x%2 != 0]
```
This is equivalent to
```python
list_comp = []
for x in range(20):
    if x%2 !=0:
        lc.append(x**2)
```
Let's break it down.

## How?
Because our list comprehension is on the right side of an =, we're assigning a new variable, "list_comp" the values we calculate with the comprehension and stored in a list.

## Why?
After getting used to the syntax (because the items don't show up in the order you'd expect them to in English), list comprehensions are fairly simple to understand. They're one line and Python can process them faster than for loops most of the time.

## When?
Use list comprehension when you're creating a list by applying some sort of function to everything, or when you want transfer some items from one list to another.

## Who?
You! You can use list comprehension anytime you like! Fiddle around with it and you'll be there in no time.

# Introduction

Have you ever discovered a new favorite board game? Or rediscovered an old favorite?

I certainly have. Often, it's when my family or friends invite me to play a game with them. Sometimes the game is good and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's designed well but I don't particularly jive with it. I've begun a project where I can more easily discover new favorite games. Hopefully that process will be helpful to you too.

The purposes of this post are

1. Spread the word about popular board game mechanics
2. Help you discover which mechanics you enjoy the most
3. Help you find some new games with mechanics you enjoy

With that out of the way, let's get to the data science stuff.
